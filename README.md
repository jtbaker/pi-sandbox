# Pi Sandbox

Run [Pi](https://pi.dev) or [omp](https://omp.sh) inside an ephemeral smolvm microVM, with a writable project directory and read-only access to the host's agent configuration.

## Prerequisites

- **smolvm** with privileged init, `--net-backend virtio-net`, `--no-init-cache`, and `--secret-env` support. Install with:
  ```bash
  curl -sSL https://smolmachines.com/install.sh | bash
  ```
- **Docker with buildx** and a running daemon, such as Docker Desktop or OrbStack.
- **realpath** on the host, used to check mount paths before starting Docker or the VM.

## Quick Start

Build and run the current working tree locally, without publishing:

```bash
docker buildx build --load -f Dockerfile.pi -t pi-sandbox:local .
PI_SANDBOX_IMAGE=pi-sandbox:local ./pi-sandbox.sh --dns 100.100.100.100 /path/to/project
```

The VM opens an interactive login shell. Run `pi` or `omp` from that shell.

To use the published image instead:

```bash
./pi-sandbox.sh --dns 100.100.100.100 /path/to/project
```

Without `PI_SANDBOX_IMAGE`, the launcher pulls `jasonbaker/pi-sandbox:latest`. A local image override skips that pull. Images must advertise the current configuration and network-policy layout. If the published image is older, the launcher builds a matching `pi-sandbox:config-local` image from the sources beside the launcher, without publishing it. An incompatible explicit override fails with a rebuild instruction. Rebuild after changing the Dockerfile, Python entrypoints, or either sandbox JSON profile.

## Usage

```bash
./pi-sandbox.sh --dns 100.100.100.100
./pi-sandbox.sh --dns 100.100.100.100 /path/to/project
./pi-sandbox.sh --agent omp --dns 100.100.100.100 /path/to/project
./pi-sandbox.sh --ssh-agent --dns 100.100.100.100 /path/to/project
./pi-sandbox.sh --help
```

`--agent` and `AGENT` select the startup hint, not an automatically launched process. Both agents remain available in the same shell. `--agent` overrides `AGENT`; accepted values are `pi` and `omp`.

The workspace must be an existing directory. The launcher resolves symlinks and rejects your home directory, its ancestors, and paths that overlap either agent configuration directory. This prevents the writable workspace from exposing the same configuration that is mounted read-only. Paths containing colons or newlines are rejected because they cannot be passed safely through smolvm's volume syntax.

The workload retains only filesystem capabilities needed to edit host-owned workspace files. Network-administration, raw-socket, namespace-administration, and privilege-escalation capabilities are removed before the shell or agent starts. Privileged nested-sandbox mode is no longer available because it would let the workload bypass the network policy; extensions that require privileged namespace creation are not supported.

### Installing Globally

Symlink the launcher into a directory on your `PATH`:

```bash
ln -s /path/to/pi-sandbox.sh /usr/local/bin/pi-sandbox
pi-sandbox /path/to/project
```

## Sharing Agent Configuration

The host sources and VM-local copies are separate:

| Agent | Read-only host source in VM | Writable VM-local configuration |
|---|---|---|
| Pi | `/root/.pi-host` from host `~/.pi` | `/root/.pi`, including `/root/.pi/agent` |
| omp | `/root/.omp-host` from host `~/.omp` | `/root/.omp`, including `/root/.omp/agent` |

At startup, `pi-agent-seed.py` snapshots each source into its own private directory. Root-level configuration, agent settings, credentials, extensions, and named profiles retain their directory structure. There is no global `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` override to mix the agents' settings or credentials.

Seeding runs before the shell starts and only once per VM. Nested shells do not refresh the snapshot or overwrite changes made by an agent. Host configuration changes take effect in the next VM, not in an existing VM's private copy. VM-local settings, refreshed tokens, and new sessions are discarded when that VM exits; nothing is synchronized back to the host. The mounted source directories remain live and readable.

Snapshot rules:

- Directories are private (`0700`). Ordinary files are `0600`; files with the owner's executable bit keep that bit as `0700`.
- Symlinks, sockets, devices, and FIFOs are not copied or followed. Symlinked extensions must be installed as ordinary files inside the VM if needed.
- Directories named `sessions`, `terminal-sessions`, `cache`, `caches`, `logs`, `bin`, `__pycache__`, or `.git` are omitted at any depth. Host binaries and cached native dependencies may not run on Linux; install required Linux dependencies in the VM.
- At each configuration root (including named profile roots), `run`, `ssh-control`, `puppeteer`, `natives`, and `.supervisor` are omitted. These contain host daemon state, browser profiles, sockets, or platform-specific binaries. A portable extension directory such as `agent/extensions/run` is still copied.
- `history.db*`, `trust.db*`, `trust.json`, `.seeded`, and SQLite journal sidecars are omitted. Host trust decisions are not imported from those files.
- SQLite `.db` files use a read-only SQLite backup, including committed WAL data, rather than a raw copy of a live database. An unreadable or invalid configuration database stops boot with its path and SQLite error instead of silently dropping credentials or printing file contents. A live WAL database must have readable WAL/SHM files; if SQLite cannot read it through the read-only mount, stop its host writer or checkpoint it before launching again.
- Pi receives `sandbox.json.autonomous` as its VM-local `agent/sandbox.json`. This is a Pi extension policy, not an omp policy or an OS-level security boundary.

Skipping history in the private copy does **not** hide it from code inside the VM: the full host source directories are still mounted read-only. Do not share a directory whose contents the agent must not read.

## LLM Backends

### Cloud Mode

When `LLM_BASE_URL` is unset or empty, nonempty `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variables are forwarded using smolvm's `--secret-env`. Their values do not appear in launcher command arguments or smolvm's persisted machine record.

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="..."
./pi-sandbox.sh /path/to/project
```

The agents can also use credentials from their copied configuration.

### Custom Model Endpoint

```bash
export LLM_BASE_URL="https://spark1.taild8834b.ts.net"
./pi-sandbox.sh --dns 100.100.100.100 /path/to/project
```

The endpoint is passed unchanged as `OPENAI_BASE_URL` and `LLM_BASE_URL` through `--secret-env`, without printing it. When it is set, the two forwarded cloud API key variables are omitted; credentials already in shared configuration are not removed.

There is no automatic host-loopback or LAN rewriting. `localhost` means the VM itself. The network policy blocks host LAN endpoints and other private services; use the permitted Spark1 HTTPS endpoint or a public endpoint.

### Tailnet DNS

If the host resolves Tailscale MagicDNS names but the VM reports `ENOTFOUND`, select the Tailscale resolver explicitly:

```bash
./pi-sandbox.sh --dns 100.100.100.100 /path/to/project
```

This requires the host's Tailscale connection and DNS service to be available. It fixes resolver selection; it does not enroll the VM as a separate Tailscale node or give it an independent access policy. Tailnet connections through the host can still use the host's permissions.

## Network Policy

`sandbox-network.json` selects `spark1.taild8834b.ts.net` on TCP port `443`. At each VM boot, trusted init resolves it, verifies that all returned addresses are Tailscale addresses, and atomically installs an nftables policy before agent configuration is seeded or any workload starts. Startup fails if resolution or policy installation fails. Addresses are pinned for that VM's lifetime; restart it after a peer address changes.

| Destination | Workload access |
|---|---|
| Public Internet | Allowed |
| Spark1's pinned Tailscale addresses | TCP 443 only |
| Other tailnet, LAN, link-local, or reserved addresses | Blocked |
| Configured DNS resolver addresses | TCP/UDP 53 only |
| VM loopback | Allowed for VM-local services |

The rule constrains destination IPs and TCP ports, not HTTP paths or the contents of HTTPS requests. Public Internet access still permits external proxies and data upload.

`pi-sandbox.smolfile` runs trusted network init with VM-grade privileges. The launcher forces `virtio-net` so packets pass through the guest kernel and uses `--no-init-cache` so every VM gets fresh rules and resolver addresses. The seeder then uses `setpriv` to retain only `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE` and `CAP_FOWNER`, with no ambient/inheritable capabilities and `no_new_privs`. The workload cannot modify nftables, create raw packet sockets, or regrant network privileges. These rules are inside the VM; no host firewall or tailnet ACL is changed.

## Security Boundaries

- The microVM is the host isolation boundary. Only the requested workspace is mounted writable; both agent configuration sources are mounted read-only.
- Trusted init configures the network before the workload runs. The workload remains root inside the guest with filesystem-only capabilities; read-only host mounts are also enforced by the backing filesystem. Private file modes do not hide credentials from the agent itself.
- SSH forwarding is **off by default**. `--ssh-agent` requires an existing `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` Unix socket. Forwarding does not copy private keys, but it allows VM processes to request signatures and authenticate as you. Prefer a dedicated agent with only the keys needed for this project.
- Credentials in shared configuration are readable inside the VM. An agent, extension, or compromised dependency can disclose them over the network. Read-only mounts prevent host-file changes; they do not prevent credential theft or use.
- The workspace is writable host state, including its `.git` directory and any secrets already in the workspace. Review changes before running host-side scripts or hooks.
- Public Internet access remains enabled; private/tailnet access is restricted by the network policy above. The host must remain connected to Tailscale. The VM is not enrolled as a separate Tailscale node.
- Agent extensions and configuration are executable/trusted inputs, not sanitized data. The Pi extension's filesystem rules are defense in depth, not a replacement for the microVM and read-only mounts.
- Trust the image source and build dependencies. Archive validation checks smolvm compatibility, not image authenticity. The cache is keyed by the current local image ID, image reference, and platform, so a newly pulled image does not silently reuse an old archive.

## Image Builds and Publishing

`Dockerfile.pi` includes Node.js 24, pinned Pi and omp releases, Python, uv, DuckDB, git, ripgrep, build tools, zsh, nftables, and util-linux. System Python supplies SQLite snapshots; `nft` installs the kernel policy and `setpriv` confines workload capabilities. No host Python dependency is required.

The launcher first exports with `docker save`. If that archive is incompatible with smolvm, it uses buildx's **Docker** exporter, not an OCI archive. Export failures stop launch; replacement of the cached archive happens only after a successful export and compatibility check. Existing buildx builders are not selected, created, or deleted by the launcher. Registry-backed export fallback uses an immutable digest. A local-only image needs a selected Docker-driver builder if `docker save` cannot export it.

`.github/workflows/build-image.yml` builds amd64 and arm64 images and publishes `latest` plus the commit SHA when the image sources or workflow change. Image sources include both Python entrypoints and `sandbox-network.json`. It requires `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` repository secrets. The host-side Smolfile must remain beside the launcher.

Local and CI publishing use BuildKit's registry exporter with `compression=zstd`, `compression-level=22`, `force-compression=true`, and `oci-mediatypes=true`. Level 22 favors smaller registry layers over export CPU time; `force-compression` also recompresses inherited layers. These settings affect published OCI layers, not necessarily the size of the local Docker-format archive used by smolvm.

`build.sh` is for deliberate multi-platform publishing, not a local-only build:

```bash
./build.sh                      # Builds and pushes latest, both platforms
./build.sh v1.0                  # Builds and pushes a specific tag
PLATFORMS=linux/amd64 ./build.sh  # Builds and pushes one platform
```

## Verification

```bash
./verify-guest.sh
```

This builds the working tree without publishing and boots disposable microVMs using only synthetic configuration. Kernel network fixtures prove allowed destination/port paths and count rejected IPv4 and IPv6 tailnet packets. Workload checks prove nftables and raw-packet bypass are denied while host-owned workspace files remain editable. The suite also checks separate agent roots, private permissions, omitted histories/runtime trees/symlinks, read-only host sources, committed SQLite WAL snapshots, consistent backups during concurrent writes, preserved VM edits across nested shells, and both agents' versions. It never mounts your real `~/.pi` or `~/.omp`. Failed runs retain their synthetic fixture directory for diagnosis.

To use an existing Docker-format image archive:

```bash
PI_SANDBOX_VERIFY_IMAGE_TAR=/path/to/image.tar ./verify-guest.sh
```
